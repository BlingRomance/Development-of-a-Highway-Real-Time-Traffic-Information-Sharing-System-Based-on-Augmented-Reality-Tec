The national freeways are the most important network of transportation in Taiwan.  

The driverâ€™s need for traffic information of the national freeways is dramatically increasing with the development of smart mobile devices and mobile networks.  

Currently, the traffic images of road conditions captured from Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau, MOTC R.O.C. can be obtained by the relevant applications of smart mobile devices.  

However, the way of receiving this road conditions will be affected by whether the cameras operate or not.  

In order to improve the existing problems and uncertain factors, implementations on latest and instant road condition sharing systems of the national freeways and practices on Android by the appliances of smart mobile devices, augmented reality and image sharing will be described in the essay.  

The system includes augmented reality, image sharing, image recognition and traffic analysis of three subsystems.  

Also, the system will provide three kinds of different image sharing models which are virtual objects POI on the user interface, the lane change and mileage axis.  

The results of image recognition and analysis can enable the driver to acquire the road conditions of specific and non-specific sections and weather conditions.  

At the same time, this applications can help the driver change the lane safely when a vehicle is in the front by sharing the images from the vehicle.  

This thesis will attempt to explore a new and latest information sharing platform of real-time traffic updates which will help the driver timely and successfully acquire the image information of the traffic so that the driver can efficiently plan the travel routes to avoid the heavy traffic and traffic congestion on the national freeways.
